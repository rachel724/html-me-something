	   			<p class="codeText2">In the summer of 2014, we launched a pilot session specifically for mothers and daughters to learn to code, and it was a huge success!  In 2015, the program ran every other month and in 2016, we began providing a session every 2nd Saturday of the month.  We also expanded the sessions to father-daughter combos!  In 2018, we added a workshop focused on hardware -- Jewelbots!</p>
	   			
	   			<p class="codeText3">During the Web Development workshop, coding duos will envision themselves as cupcake shop owners in need of creating a website to show off their baked goods.  They'll learn website building from start to finish, doing everything from displaying their own copy to adding a color theme to suit their tastes, to hosting their site on Github Pages.</p>
	   			<p class="codeText4">Jewelbots are friendship bracelets for the iPhone era.  Technology-enabled jewelry for tween and teen girls, they're a means of communicating with fiends by lighting up when a BFF is near or buzzing to send messages to a pal across the school.</p>
